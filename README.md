# PAPABEAR by MarQuez LeDay

PapaBear is an app made by a first time dad for first time dads.

The basic funtion of the app today is a simple task manager. You are able to add and delete your daily tasks. 


PapaBear was made using React-Native and Node.js. This was my first attempt at using React-Native. I had some technical challenges starting out such as trying to get everything working for my M1 Mac. Once I was able to get through that I was able to run expo on my computer in order to make my app. 

React-Native is very similiar to React but it does have some syntax that takes getting use to. I enjoyed using Native though. 


Since this was made in React-Native this is mainly a mobile application so you will need to download expo go on your device and then scan the provided QR code on the site below:
